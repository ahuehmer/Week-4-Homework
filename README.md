# Week-4-Homework - Pandas Challenge

This week's challenge consisted of a analysis of standardized test score data of students from different schools within a district to support future school budget decisions. 
The data was analyzed based on different factors for example students' test scores and passing rates based on different grades, individual schools, school size, type, and spending.

### **The following conclusions were drawn from the results:**

Overall, it can be seen that all schools had average math and reading scores that were above passing. Additionally, higher per student budgets and larger total budgets did not yield higher test scores or higher passing percentages. Math and reading scores remained more consistent amongst 11th graders and varied more amongst  9th, 10th, and 12th graders with reading scores varying less and being overall better than the math scores. Furthermore, smaller and medium schools had similar scores and passing rates, which were higher than for large schools. Lastly, it can be observed that charter schools had higher test scores and much higher passing rates than district schools. 


**From this, two important conclusions can be drawn:**
- Higher school and per student funding does not seem to have a positive effect on test scores and passing rates. 
- School size and type had a much more visible impact on test results and passing rates with smaller (<1000) and medium schools (1000-2000) doing better than large (2000-5000) schools, while charter schools also outperformed district schools.
